# Unit 18 PWA Homework: Online/Offline Budget Trackers

## Description
This is a simple budget tracking application that lets users add funds and subtract expenses. The main purpose of the app is to showcase an example of a Progressive Web App with data persistence. The app can be downloaded as an application that can work outside the browser. It also can keep saving user data locally using the indexedDB browser API when the app is offline, and sync to the MongoDB database when coming back online.


## User Story
AS AN avid traveller
I WANT to be able to track my withdrawals and deposits with or without a data/internet connection
SO THAT my account balance is accurate when I am traveling
